Nontrinitarian Christians, who reject the doctrine of the Trinity, differ significantly from mainstream Christianity in their beliefs about the Holy Spirit. In Christian theology, pneumatology is the study of the Holy Spirit. Due to Christianity's historical relationship with Judaism, theologians often identify the Holy Spirit with the concept of the Ruach Hakodesh in Jewish scripture, on the theory that Jesus was expanding upon these Jewish concepts. Similar names, and ideas, include the Ruach Elohim, Ruach YHWH, and the Ruach Hakodesh.

It is the successor corporation to Colt's earlier firearms-making efforts, which started in 1836. Colt is known for the engineering, production, and marketing of firearms, especially during the century from 1850 through World War I, when it dominated its industry and was a seminal influence on manufacturing technology. Colt's earliest designs played a major role in the popularization of the revolver and the shift away from single-shot pistols. Although Samuel Colt did not invent the revolver, his designs resulted in the first very successful model.",

His book <i>The English Physitian</i> is a source of pharmaceutical and herbal lore of the time, and <i>Astrological Judgement of Diseases from the Decumbiture of the Sick</i> (1655) one of the most detailed works on medical astrology in Early Modern Europe. Culpeper catalogued hundreds of outdoor medicinal herbs. He scolded contemporaries for some of the methods they used in herbal medicine: \"This not being pleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers, <span class=\"smallcaps\">Dr. Reason</span> and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Dr. Experience</span>, and took a voyage to visit my mother <span class=\"smallcaps\">Nature</span>, by whose advice, together with the help of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Dr. Diligence</span>, I at last obtained my desire; and, being warned by <span class=\"smallcaps\">Mr. Honesty</span>, a stranger in our days, to publish it to the world, I have done it.\"</p>",
