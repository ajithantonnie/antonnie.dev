Lewis was best known for his discovery of the covalent bond and his concept of electron pairs; his Lewis dot structures and other contributions to valence bond theory have shaped modern theories of chemical bonding. Lewis successfully contributed to chemical thermodynamics, photochemistry, and isotope separation, and is also known for his concept of acids and bases. Lewis also researched on relativity and quantum physics, and in 1926 he coined the term \"photon\" for the smallest unit of radiant energy.</p>",

On October 23, the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h).
