On 29 December 2024, when the Boeing 737-800 operating the flight was approaching Muan, a bird strike occurred, with both of the engines ingesting birds, causing an apparent loss of thrust in the right engine. The pilots issued a mayday alert, performed a go-around, and on the second landing attempt, the landing gear did not deploy and the airplane belly-landed well beyond the normal touchdown zone. It overran the runway at high speed, collided with the approach lighting system, and crashed into a berm encasing a concrete structure that supported an antenna array for the instrument landing system (ILS). The collision killed all 175 passengers and 4 of the 6 crew members. The surviving two cabin crew were seated in the rear of the plane, which detached from the fuselage, and were rescued with injuries. Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) stopped functioning a few seconds before the mayday call, and evidence of a bird strike with a species of migratory duck was later found in both engines, with the right engine having sustained severe bird damage. In July 2025, South Korean media reported that the investigation board found that the crew mistakenly turned off the relatively unscathed left engine rather than the badly damaged right engine.",

All but the lead locomotive plunged into the river. The train's oil lanterns and coal-fired heating stoves set the wooden cars alight. Firefighters declined to extinguish the flames, leaving individuals to try to pull survivors from the wreck. Many who survived the crash burned to death in the wreckage. The accident killed approximately 92 of the 160 people aboard. It was the worst rail accident in the U.S. in the 19th century and the worst rail accident in U.S. history until the Great Train Wreck of 1918.
