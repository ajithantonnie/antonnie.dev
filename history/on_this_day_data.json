They expressed grievances against the government's supervision of the military, and demanded the resignation of Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes, PNP Chief Hermogenes Ebdane, and AFP Chief of Intelligence Service Victor Corpus; they also aired their grievances against the military establishment and anomalies on the AFP. The mutiny was covered heavily by the local press, with ABS-CBN News writer Joel Saracho dubbing the group \"Magdalo\" in reference to their insignia, mistakenly assuming it referred to the Magdalo faction of the Katipunan during the Philippine Revolution, despite the group officially calling themselves \"Bagong Katipuneros\". The mutiny ended after the government successfully negotiated with the group. Several prominent participants of the mutiny, including Trillanes and Gambala, were later charged.",

Gerardo Gambala and Navy Lt. Senior Grade Antonio Trillanes IV against the Arroyo administration. The group forcibly seized and occupied Oakwood Premier in Glorietta, Makati, for almost 20 hours. They expressed grievances against the government's supervision of the military, and demanded the resignation of Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes, PNP Chief Hermogenes Ebdane, and AFP Chief of Intelligence Service Victor Corpus; they also aired their grievances against the military establishment and anomalies on the AFP. The mutiny was covered heavily by the local press, with ABS-CBN News writer Joel Saracho dubbing the group \"Magdalo\" in reference to their insignia, mistakenly assuming it referred to the Magdalo faction of the Katipunan during the Philippine Revolution, despite the group officially calling themselves \"<i>Bagong Katipuneros</i><span>\"</span>. The mutiny ended after the government successfully negotiated with the group. Several prominent participants of the mutiny, including Trillanes and Gambala, were later charged.</p>",

It culminated in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade, which took place on 3 December 1854 at Ballarat between the rebels and the colonial forces of Australia. The fighting resulted in an official total of 27 deaths and many injuries, the majority of casualties being rebels. There was a preceding period beginning in 1851 of peaceful demonstrations and civil disobedience on the Victorian goldfields. The miners had various grievances, chiefly the cost of mining permits and the officious way the system was enforced.</p>",

They were killed by a small group of Cayuse men who suspected that Whitman had poisoned the 200 Cayuse in his medical care during an outbreak of measles that included the Whitman household. The killings occurred at the Whitman Mission at the junction of the Walla Walla River and Mill Creek in what is now southeastern Washington near Walla Walla. The massacre became a decisive episode in the U.S. settlement of the Pacific Northwest, causing the United States Congress to take action declaring the territorial status of the Oregon Country. The Oregon Territory was established on August 14, 1848, to protect the White settlers.",
