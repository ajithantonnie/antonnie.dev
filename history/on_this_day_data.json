The tip had been created on a mountain slope above the Welsh village of Aberfan, near Merthyr Tydfil, and overlaid a natural spring. Heavy rain led to a build-up of water within the tip which caused it to suddenly slide downhill as a slurry, killing 116 children and 28 adults as it engulfed Pantglas Junior School and a row of houses. The tip was the responsibility of the National Coal Board (NCB), and the subsequent inquiry placed the blame for the disaster on the organisation and nine named employees.",

First garnering a mass following on social media, he released his debut extended play (EP) Closer in June 2015, and followed it up with the single, \"Used to Love You Sober\" in October of that year. After Brown signed with RCA Nashville in early 2016, the song was included on his second EP and major label debut, Chapter 1 in March 2016. He released his eponymous debut studio album later that year in December. The album spawned the single \"What Ifs\", and in October 2017, Brown became the first artist to have simultaneous number ones on all five main Billboard country charts.

He led the Dalit entry into the Baidyanath Dham, Deoghar. He was the first chief minister in the country to abolish the zamindari system. He was imprisoned for a total of about eight years in British India. He held mass meetings at which he spoke. He was known as <i>Bihar Kesari</i> for his \"lionlike roars\" in public speaking.</p>",

The island was occupied with little resistance from the small Ottoman garrison, which was taken prisoner. Mudros Bay was made into a forward naval base for the Greek navy, enabling it to blockade the Dardanelles and secure naval dominance in the Aegean. This obstructed the movement of Ottoman reinforcements to the front lines, and allowed the capture of the remaining Ottoman-held Aegean islands over the following months. Ceded to Greece in 1914, due to the subsequent outbreak of World War I, the island's status remained disputed, and its annexation to Greece was not confirmed until the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.",
