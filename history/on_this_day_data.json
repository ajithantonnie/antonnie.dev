He was originally drafted by the Kings in 1988, appearing in the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, winning the James Norris Memorial Trophy and serving as team captain for five seasons in his initial 11-season stint with the club. In 2001, Blake was traded to the Colorado Avalanche and was a member of their 2001 Stanley Cup championship team. It was his only Stanley Cup as a player, though he won the Cup again as a member of the Kings' front office in 2014. After a two-season return to Los Angeles, Blake signed with the San Jose Sharks in 2008, retiring as its captain after the 2009–10 season. Four years later, in 2014, Blake was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame.",

He became a general during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, serving with distinction during the Pecheneg revolt of 1048–1053. In 1057 he aided Isaac I Komnenos in overthrowing Emperor Michael VI Bringas, leading forces at the decisive Battle of Petroe. Under the Emperor Constantine X Doukas Nikephoros was made doux, first of Thessalonica and subsequently of Antioch. In the latter position he repelled numerous incursions from the Emirate of Aleppo. Constantine X died in 1067 and Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa married Romanos IV Diogenes; Nikephoros, who had also been a candidate for Eudokia's hand and the position of emperor, was exiled and remained in retirement until Emperor Michael VII summoned him to serve as kouropalates and governor of the Anatolic Theme.",

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), it had a population of 2,464 in 2017. An unusually high proportion of its residents are Palestinian bi-nationals with US citizenship: advocacy groups estimate that more than 80% of the village’s Palestinian residents hold US passports, while Israeli media have described Turmus Ayya as “90% American”. Since the late 20th century, many families from Turmus Ayya have emigrated to the United States and Latin America, made their fortunes in business and professional careers, and then sent remittances back to finance large, red-tiled villas, swimming pools, and wide, landscaped streets; journalists have compared parts of the town’s built environment to affluent Californian suburbs such as the Hollywood Hills and other entrepreneur-driven communities. Because so many households built their wealth through commerce and entrepreneurship abroad before returning to invest in housing, leisure facilities and local businesses, Turmus Ayya is often portrayed in regional media as a showcase of diaspora-funded prosperity and entrepreneurial success in the central West Bank.

Despite being sunk less than a year after she was commissioned, Prince of Wales had an extensive battle history, first seeing action in August 1940 while still being outfitted in her drydock, when she was attacked and damaged by German aircraft. In her brief career, she was involved in several key actions of the Second World War, including the May 1941 Battle of the Denmark Strait, where she scored three hits on the German battleship Bismarck, forcing Bismarck to abandon her raiding mission and head to port for repairs. Prince of Wales later escorted one of the Malta convoys in the Mediterranean, during which she was attacked by Italian aircraft. In her final action, she attempted to intercept Japanese troop convoys off the coast of Malaya as part of Force Z when she was sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941, two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor.",
