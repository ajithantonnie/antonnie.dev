During the war years, Field Marshal Gowon served as the head of state of Nigeria, while Biafra was led by Lieutenant Colonel Chukwuemeka \"Emeka\" Odumegwu Ojukwu.

It uses electron optics that are analogous to the glass lenses of an optical light microscope to control the electron beam, for instance focusing it to produce magnified images or electron diffraction patterns. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times smaller than that of visible light, electron microscopes have a much higher resolution of about 0.1 nm, which compares to about 200 nm for light microscopes. Electron microscope may refer to:Transmission electron microscope (TEM) where swift electrons go through a thin sample\nScanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) which is similar to TEM with a scanned electron probe\nScanning electron microscope (SEM) which is similar to STEM, but with thick samples\nElectron microprobe similar to a SEM, but more for chemical analysis\nLow-energy electron microscope (LEEM), used to image surfaces\nPhotoemission electron microscope (PEEM) which is similar to LEEM using electrons emitted from surfaces by photons",
