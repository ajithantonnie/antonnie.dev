Grant issued the order in an effort to reduce corruption among Union soldiers and stop the illicit trade in Southern-produced cotton, which he perceived as being run \"mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders\". During the war, the Lincoln administration had authorized licensed traders to do business with the Union army, which created a market for unlicensed ones.

Hitchcock became a major league coach in January of 1996 when the Dallas Stars named him coach with 43 games remaining in the season.

He was hired by the Philadelphia Flyers in 2002 and coached them to three playoff appearances, which included a Conference Finals appearance in 2004 but was fired eight games into the 2006 season.

Following the Exclusion Crisis and the failure of the nascent Whig faction to disinherit James, Duke of York in favour of Charles II's illegitimate son James, 1st Duke of Monmouth, L'Estrange used his newspaper The Observator to harangue his opponents and act as a voice for a popular provincial Toryism during the 'Tory Reaction' of 1681–85. Despite serving as an MP from 1685 to 1689 his stock fell under James II's reign as his staunch hostility to religious nonconformism conflicted with James's goals of religious tolerance for both Catholics and Nonconformists. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the collapse of the Restoration political order heralded the end of L'Estrange's career in public life, although his greatest translation work, that of Aesop's Fables, saw publication in 1692.",

Following the Exclusion Crisis and the failure of the nascent Whig faction to disinherit James, Duke of York in favour of Charles II's illegitimate son James, 1st Duke of Monmouth, L'Estrange used his newspaper <i>The Observator</i> to harangue his opponents and act as a voice for a popular provincial Toryism during the 'Tory Reaction' of 1681–85. Despite serving as an MP from 1685 to 1689 his stock fell under James II's reign as his staunch hostility to religious nonconformism conflicted with James's goals of religious tolerance for both Catholics and Nonconformists. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the collapse of the Restoration political order heralded the end of L'Estrange's career in public life, although his greatest translation work, that of Aesop's Fables, saw publication in 1692.</p>",
