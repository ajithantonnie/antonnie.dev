The sport is similar to water-based kiteboarding, but with the footwear used in snowboarding or skiing. The principles of using the kite are the same, but in different terrain. In the early days of snowkiting, foil kites were the most common type; nowadays many kiteboarders use inflatable kites. However, since 2013, newly developed racing foil kites seem to dominate speed races and expedition races, like Red Bull Ragnarok and the Vake mini-expedition race. Snowkiting differs from other alpine sports in that it is possible for the snowkiter to travel uphill and downhill with any wind direction. Like kiteboarding, snowkiting can be very hazardous and should be learned and practiced with care. Snowkiting has become more popular in places often associated with skiing and snowboarding, such as Russia, Canada, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Northern and Central United States. The sport has become more diverse as adventurers use kites to travel great distances and sports enthusiasts push the boundaries of freestyle, big air, speed and back country exploration.",

This magnitude scale is related to the local magnitude scale proposed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935, with modifications from both Richter and Beno Gutenberg throughout the 1940s and 1950s. It is currently used in People's Republic of China as a national standard for categorising earthquakes.</p><blockquote class=\"templatequote \"><p>The successful development of the local-magnitude scale encouraged Gutenberg and Richter to develop magnitude scales based on teleseismic observations of earthquakes. Two scales were developed, one based on surface waves, <span class=\"mwe-math-element mwe-math-element-inline\"><img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4d1fa004b02a8c21a66e5331b1708864d7f4fa5\" class=\"mwe-math-fallback-image-inline mw-invert skin-invert\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.671ex;width:3.257ex;height:2.509ex\" /></span>, and one on body waves, <span class=\"mwe-math-element mwe-math-element-inline\"><img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/692c858929a1951aae19d1f230585a989869c77b\" class=\"mwe-math-fallback-image-inline mw-invert skin-invert\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.671ex;width:3.192ex;height:2.509ex\" /></span>.\n\nSurface waves with a period near 20 s generally produce the largest amplitudes on a standard long-period seismograph, and so the amplitude of these waves is used to determine <span class=\"mwe-math-element mwe-math-element-inline\"><img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4d1fa004b02a8c21a66e5331b1708864d7f4fa5\" class=\"mwe-math-fallback-image-inline mw-invert skin-invert\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.671ex;width:3.257ex;height:2.509ex\" /></span>, using an equation similar to that used for <span class=\"mwe-math-element mwe-math-element-inline\"><img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a51380c10c3ca778e845d3a7cead1152798f8da8\" class=\"mwe-math-fallback-image-inline mw-invert skin-invert\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"vertical-align:-0.671ex;width:3.606ex;height:2.509ex\" /></span>.</p></blockquote>",

Antoni's work focuses on process and the transitions between the making and finished product, often portraying feminist ideals. She emphasizes the human body in her pieces, such as her mouth, hair, eyelashes, and, through technological scanning, her brain. Antoni uses her body as a tool of creation or as the subject of her pieces, exploring intimacy between the spectator and the artist. Her work blurs the distinction between performance art and sculpture.</p>",

He is often referred to as the ‘‘Shaheed President’’ in Bangladesh. He also founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).</p>",

The sport is similar to water-based kiteboarding, but with the footwear used in snowboarding or skiing. The principles of using the kite are the same, but in different terrain. In the early days of snowkiting, foil kites were the most common type; nowadays many kiteboarders use inflatable kites. However, since 2013, newly developed racing foil kites seem to dominate speed races and expedition races, like Red Bull Ragnarok and the Vake mini-expedition race. Snowkiting differs from other alpine sports in that it is possible for the snowkiter to travel uphill and downhill with any wind direction. Like kiteboarding, snowkiting can be very hazardous and should be learned and practiced with care. Snowkiting has become more popular in places often associated with skiing and snowboarding, such as Russia, Canada, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Northern and Central United States. The sport has become more diverse as adventurers use kites to travel great distances and sports enthusiasts push the boundaries of freestyle, big air, speed and back country exploration.",

As a theologian and a scholar, he was instrumental in the preparations for the Council of Ferrara–Florence, and as Metropolitan of Ephesus and delegate for the Patriarch of Alexandria, he was one of the most important voices at the synod. At the beginning of the Council, Mark was initially favorable toward accepting the union.

Over this period, he distanced himself from the idea of accepting the union, concluding that the teachings of the Western Church were inconsistent with the dogmas of the Ecumenical Councils. After renouncing the council as a lost cause, Mark became the leader of the Orthodox opposition to the Union of Florence, thus sealing his reputation as a defender of Eastern Orthodoxy and pillar of the Eastern Orthodox Church.",
