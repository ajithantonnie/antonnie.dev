There was speculation that the attack was ideologically motivated, as most of the victims were immigrants, and it was early on, falsely, reported by Swedish TV4 that Andersson had supposedly made a racist statement during the shooting. This rumour by TV4 was later debunked by Swedish audio technicians and the Police and with the help of FBI experts it was ruled out as a false claim.
