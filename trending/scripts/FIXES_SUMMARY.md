# News Generator - Issues Fixed

## Summary of Issues Corrected

### 1. **Missing Dependency Issue**
- **Problem**: `googlesearch` import error - package not installed
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `googlesearch-python==1.2.3` to `requirements.txt`
  - Installed the package using Python environment tools
  - Added proper import error handling with fallback functionality

### 2. **Import Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Script would crash if googlesearch package wasn't available
- **Solution**: Added try-except block around import with graceful fallback
```python
try:
    from googlesearch import search as google_search
except ImportError:
    print("Warning: googlesearch-python not installed. Using fallback search.")
    google_search = None
```

### 3. **File Path Issues**
- **Problem**: Relative path `../posts/` could cause issues depending on execution context
- **Solution**: Changed to absolute path using script directory
```python
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
self.posts_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(script_dir), "posts")
```

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Limited error handling for web requests and file operations
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling for:
  - Request timeouts
  - Connection errors
  - Content type validation
  - File encoding issues
  - HTML content extraction failures

### 5. **Web Scraping Improvements**
- **Problem**: Basic web scraping could fail on various website types
- **Solution**: 
  - Added content-type checking
  - Improved meaningful content filtering
  - Better handling of non-HTML responses
  - Enhanced timeout and redirect handling

### 6. **HTML Security**
- **Problem**: User-generated content not properly escaped in HTML output
- **Solution**: Added HTML escaping using `html.escape()` for all dynamic content

### 7. **File Creation Robustness**
- **Problem**: File creation could fail without proper fallback
- **Solution**: Added fallback filename generation and better error reporting

## Files Modified

1. **`requirements.txt`**: Added `googlesearch-python==1.2.3`
2. **`news_generator.py`**: Multiple improvements for reliability and error handling
3. **`test_generator.py`**: Created test script to verify functionality

## Dependencies Installed

- `googlesearch-python==1.2.3`
- `requests==2.31.0`
- `beautifulsoup4==4.12.2`
- `feedparser>=6.0.11`
- `lxml` and `lxml[html_clean]`

## Testing

The script has been tested and verified to:
- Import successfully without errors
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully
- Create proper file paths
- Generate fallback content when needed
- Pass all basic functionality tests

## Usage

You can now run the news generator script:
```bash
python news_generator.py
```

Or run the test script first to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_generator.py
```

The script will now work reliably even if some external services are unavailable, thanks to the comprehensive fallbacks and error handling.
