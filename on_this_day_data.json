Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II is the deadliest conflict in history, causing the death of 70 to 85 million people, more than half of whom were civilians. Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were tried for war crimes.</p>",

After the Nazi occupation of France, he was interned in a concentration camp, but escaped and joined the French Resistance. With the liberation of France, he resumed his agitation for Algerian independence, calling for a social revolution to overthrow the French colonial empire. In his writings, he depicted native Kabyles as having their own libertarian and egalitarian tradition, and proposed the establishment of a non-hierarchical and secular society in an independent Algeria. He continued his activism up until his death, one year before the Algerian War of Independence broke out.",

After World War I, he joined the French anarchist movement and began agitating for Algerian independence. He was arrested and imprisoned several times during the 1930s, due to his anti-colonialist, anti-militarist and anti-fascist activism. He volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War and served in the Durruti Column until he was wounded and forced to return to France. After the Nazi occupation of France, he was interned in a concentration camp, but escaped and joined the French Resistance. With the liberation of France, he resumed his agitation for Algerian independence, calling for a social revolution to overthrow the French colonial empire. In his writings, he depicted native Kabyles as having their own libertarian and egalitarian tradition, and proposed the establishment of a non-hierarchical and secular society in an independent Algeria. He continued his activism up until his death, one year before the Algerian War of Independence broke out.</p>",

Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced, and therefore the riskiest option. Several reduced-scale aircraft, designated Avro 707s, were produced to test and refine the delta-wing design principles.",

The explosion, which killed 439 miners and a rescuer, is the worst mining accident in the United Kingdom. Universal Colliery, on the South Wales Coalfield, extracted steam coal, which was much in demand. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen.",
